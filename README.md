# WORKPLAY E-COMMERCE using React and Firebase

An E-commerce webapp using React and Firebase v9 with Paypal payment feature.

I applied what I've learned in React (state, reducer, context, router)

## Features

- Payment using react PayPal api
- Authentication using Firebase (email, gmail)
- Login, Logout, Signup, and Forgot password feature
- Real time storage (product stocks) using Firestore
- Products can be out of stock
- Cart storage using local storage
- Has search, filter, sort, and order history of products.
- View by grid or list
- Responsive website

_It didn't screen capture the popup window of paypal and google auth_
_It's better if you try the link instead and experience it ;)_
